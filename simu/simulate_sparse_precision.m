%       - p: dimension
%       - sparsity: sparsity degree, precentage of p*(p-1)/2 set as zero
%       coefficients
%       - threshold: controls for how many zero coefficients are generated
%       in the true vector of coefficients; the higher, the more zero
%       coefficients are generated
%       - a1 and a2: lower and upper bounds of the interval for the uniform
%       distribution when generating the true non-zero off-diag coefficients
%       - b1 and b2: lower and upper bounds of the interval for the uniform
%       distribution when generating the true non-zero diagonal coefficients
